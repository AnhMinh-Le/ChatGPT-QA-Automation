Issue Description:
1. Line 2: The function name is not descriptive enough. It should be named something like "find_min_cost_path".
2. Line 4: The comment is not necessary as it just repeats what the code is doing.
3. Line 6: The variable name "min_cost_arr" is not descriptive enough. It should be named something like "min_cost_matrix".
4. Line 8: The comment is not necessary as it just repeats what the code is doing.
5. Line 10-14: The initialization of the first row and column can be combined into one loop.
6. Line 16-22: The nested loop can be simplified using a list comprehension.
7. Line 24: The comment is not necessary as it just repeats what the code is doing.

Fix Recommendation:
1. Rename the function to "find_min_cost_path".
2. Remove the comment on line 4.
3. Rename "min_cost_arr" to "min_cost_matrix".
4. Remove the comment on line 8.
5. Combine the initialization of the first row and column into one loop:
```
for i in range(1, m+1):
    for j in range(1, n+1):
        if i == 1:
            min_cost_matrix[i][j] = min_cost_matrix[i][j-1] + cost[i-1][j-1]
        elif j == 1:
            min_cost_matrix[i][j] = min_cost_matrix[i-1][j] + cost[i-1][j-1]
```
6. Simplify the nested loop using a list comprehension:
```
min_cost_matrix = [[0 for j in range(n+1)] for i in range(m+1)]
min_cost_matrix[0][0] = cost[0][0]
for i in range(1, m+1):
    for j in range(1, n+1):
        if i == 1:
            min_cost_matrix[i][j] = min_cost_matrix[i][j-1] + cost[i-1][j-1]
        elif j == 1:
            min_cost_matrix[i][j] = min_cost_matrix[i-1][j] + cost[i-1][j-1]
        else:
            min_cost_matrix[i][j] = cost[i-1][j-1] + min(min_cost_matrix[i-1][j], min_cost_matrix[i][j-1])
```
7. Remove the comment on line 24.
