Task ID: 202
Issue Description:
1. Line 1: Missing module docstring (C0114)
2. Line 7 and 12: Trailing whitespace (C0303)
3. Line 9: Consider using enumerate instead of iterating with range and len (C0200)
4. Line 20: Final newline missing (C0304)
5. Line 1: Module name "202-remove_even" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (C0103)
6. Line 4-7: Docstring should be more descriptive and include information about the input and output of the function.
7. Line 7: The line is too long (86 > 79 characters) (E501)
8. Line 12: Blank line contains whitespace (W293)
9. Line 14-18: The loop can be simplified using slicing.

Fix Recommendation:
1. Add a module docstring to the code to describe the purpose of the module.
2. Remove the trailing whitespace from lines 7 and 12.
3. Use enumerate instead of range and len to simplify the loop on line 9.
4. Add a final newline to the end of the file.
5. Rename the module to follow snake_case naming conventions.
6. Update the docstring to be more descriptive and include information about the input and output of the function.
7. Break the line on line 7 into multiple lines to make it shorter than 79 characters.
8. Remove the whitespace from the blank line on line 12.
9. Simplify the loop on lines 14-18 using slicing. 
Here is the updated code:
"""
This module provides a function to remove even characters from a string.
"""
def remove_even(string: str) -> str:
    """
    This function removes even characters in a string and returns the modified string.
    Args:
        string: A string to remove even characters from.
    Returns:
        The modified string with even characters removed.
    """
    # Initialize an empty string to store the modified string
    new_string = ""
    # Loop through the string and append only odd characters to the new string
    for index, char in enumerate(string):
        if index % 2 != 0:
            new_string += char
    # Return the modified string
    return new_string
# Call the function with a sample string
result = remove_even("Hello World")
# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 'el ol'
