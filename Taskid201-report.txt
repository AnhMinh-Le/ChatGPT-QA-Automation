Task ID: 201
Issue Description:
1. Line 1: The module name "201-chkList" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style.
2. Line 1: Missing module docstring.
3. Line 6: Final newline missing.
4. Line 7: Missing function or method docstring.
5. Line 7: Function name "chkList" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style.
6. Line 3: The if statement can be replaced with 'return bool(test)'.
7. Line 5: Unnecessary "else" after "return", remove the "else" and de-indent the code inside it.

Fix Recommendation:
1. Rename the module to conform to snake_case naming style.
2. Add a module docstring to describe the purpose of the module.
3. Add a final newline at the end of the file.
4. Add a function docstring to describe the purpose of the function.
5. Rename the function to conform to snake_case naming style.
6. Replace the if statement with 'return bool(test)' to simplify the code.
7. Remove the "else" and de-indent the code inside it to make the code more readable.
Here is the updated code:
```
def check_list(lst):
    """
    Check if all elements in the list are the same.
    Args:
    lst: A list of elements.
    Returns:
    True if all elements in the list are the same, False otherwise.
    """
    test = all(elem == lst[0] for elem in lst)
    return bool(test)
```
