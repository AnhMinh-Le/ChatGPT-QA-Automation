Task ID: 213
Issue Description:
1. W293: There are two blank lines that contain whitespace at line 5 and line 8.
2. E305: There should be two blank lines after the function definition, but only one is present at line 15.
3. W292: There is no newline at the end of the file.
4. C0303: There is trailing whitespace at line 5 and line 8.
5. C0304: There is no final newline at the end of the file.
6. C0114: There is no module docstring at line 1.
7. C0103: The module name "213-concatenate_strings" does not conform to snake_case naming style at line 1.
8. C0116: There is no function or method docstring at line 1.
9. W0621: The names 'test_tup1' and 'test_tup2' are redefined from outer scope at line 13 and line 14, respectively.

Fix Recommendation:
1. Remove the whitespace from the blank lines at line 5 and line 8.
2. Add another blank line after the function definition at line 15.
3. Add a newline at the end of the file.
4. Remove the trailing whitespace at line 5 and line 8.
5. Add a final newline at the end of the file.
6. Add a module docstring to describe the purpose of the module at line 1.
7. Rename the module to 'concatenate_strings' to conform to snake_case naming style at line 1.
8. Add a function docstring to describe the purpose of the function at line 1.
9. Rename the variables 'test_tup1' and 'test_tup2' to avoid redefining them from outer scope at line 13 and line 14, respectively.
10. Rename the variable 'result' to avoid redefining it from outer scope at line 15.
